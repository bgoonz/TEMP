# big.js

**A small, fast JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic.**

The little sister to [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/) and [decimal.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/). See [here](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/wiki) for some notes on the difference between them.

## Features

* Faster, smaller and easier-to-use than JavaScript versions of Java's BigDecimal
* Only 5.9 KB minified and 2.7 KB gzipped
* Simple API
* Replicates the `toExponential`, `toFixed` and `toPrecision` methods of JavaScript's Number type
* Includes a `sqrt` method
* Stores values in an accessible decimal floating point format
* No dependencies
* Comprehensive [documentation](http://mikemcl.github.io/big.js/) and test set

## Set up

The library is the single JavaScript file _big.js_ \(or _big.min.js_, which is _big.js_ minified\).

Browser:

```markup
<script src='path/to/big.js'></script>
```

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org):

```bash
$ npm install big.js
```

```javascript
const Big = require('big.js');
```

ES6 module:

```javascript
import Big from 'big.mjs';
```

## Use

_In all examples below, `var`, semicolons and `toString` calls are not shown. If a commented-out value is in quotes it means `toString` has been called on the preceding expression._

The library exports a single function, `Big`, the constructor of Big number instances. It accepts a value of type number, string or Big number object.

```text
x = new Big(123.4567)
y = Big('123456.7e-3')             // 'new' is optional
z = new Big(x)
x.eq(y) && x.eq(z) && y.eq(z)      // true
```

A Big number is immutable in the sense that it is not changed by its methods.

```text
0.3 - 0.1                          // 0.19999999999999998
x = new Big(0.3)
x.minus(0.1)                       // "0.2"
x                                  // "0.3"
```

The methods that return a Big number can be chained.

```text
x.div(y).plus(z).times(9).minus('1.234567801234567e+8').plus(976.54321).div('2598.11772')
x.sqrt().div(y).pow(3).gt(y.mod(z))    // true
```

Like JavaScript's Number type, there are `toExponential`, `toFixed` and `toPrecision` methods.

```text
x = new Big(255.5)
x.toExponential(5)                 // "2.55500e+2"
x.toFixed(5)                       // "255.50000"
x.toPrecision(5)                   // "255.50"
```

The arithmetic methods always return the exact result except `div`, `sqrt` and `pow` \(with negative exponent\), as these methods involve division.

The maximum number of decimal places and the rounding mode used to round the results of these methods is determined by the value of the `DP` and `RM` properties of the `Big` number constructor.

```text
Big.DP = 10
Big.RM = 1

x = new Big(2);
y = new Big(3);
z = x.div(y)                       // "0.6666666667"
z.sqrt()                           // "0.8164965809"
z.pow(-3)                          // "3.3749999995"
z.times(z)                         // "0.44444444448888888889"
z.times(z).round(10)               // "0.4444444445"
```

Multiple Big number constructors can be created, each with an independent configuration.

The value of a Big number is stored in a decimal floating point format in terms of a coefficient, exponent and sign.

```text
x = new Big(-123.456);
x.c                                // [1,2,3,4,5,6]    coefficient (i.e. significand)
x.e                                // 2                exponent
x.s                                // -1               sign
```

For further information see the [API](http://mikemcl.github.io/big.js/) reference from the _doc_ folder.

## Test

The _test_ directory contains the test scripts for each Big number method.

The tests can be run with Node.js or a browser.

To run all the tests

```text
$ npm test
```

To test a single method

```text
$ node test/toFixed
```

For the browser, see _single-test.html_ and _every-test.html_ in the _test/browser_ directory.

_big-vs-number.html_ is a simple application that enables some of the methods of big.js to be compared with those of JavaScript's Number type.

## Performance

The _perf_ directory contains two legacy applications and a _lib_ directory containing the BigDecimal libraries used by both.

_big-vs-bigdecimal.html_ tests the performance of big.js against the JavaScript translations of two versions of BigDecimal, its use should be more or less self-explanatory.

* [GWT: java.math.BigDecimal](https://github.com/iriscouch/bigdecimal.js)
* [ICU4J: com.ibm.icu.math.BigDecimal](https://github.com/dtrebbien/BigDecimal.js)

The BigDecimal in the npm registry is the GWT version. It has some bugs, see the Node.js script _perf/lib/bigdecimal\_GWT/bugs.js_ for examples of flaws in its _remainder_, _divide_ and _compareTo_ methods.

_bigtime.js_ is a Node.js command-line application which tests the performance of big.js against the GWT version of BigDecimal from the npm registry.

For example, to compare the time taken by the big.js `plus` method and the BigDecimal `add` method

```text
$ node bigtime plus 10000 40
```

This will time 10000 calls to each, using operands of up to 40 random digits and will check that the results match.

For help

```text
$ node bigtime -h
```

## Build

If [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) is installed globally

```text
$ npm install uglify-js -g
```

then

```text
$ npm run build
```

will create _big.min.js_.

## TypeScript

The [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) project has a Typescript type definitions file for big.js.

```text
$ npm install @types/big.js
```

Any questions about the TypeScript type definitions file should be addressed to the DefinitelyTyped project.
