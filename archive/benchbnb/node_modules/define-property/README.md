## Usage

**Params**

* `object`: The object on which to define the property.
* `key`: The name of the property to be defined or modified.
* `value`: The value or descriptor of the property being defined or modified.

```javascript
var define = require('define-property');
var obj = {};
define(obj, 'foo', function(val) {
  return val.toUpperCase();
});

// by default, defined properties are non-enumberable
console.log(obj);
//=> {}

console.log(obj.foo('bar'));
//=> 'BAR'
```

**defining setters/getters**

Pass the same properties you would if using [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) or [Reflect.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/defineProperty).

define(obj, 'foo', {
  set: function() {},
  get: function() {}
});
